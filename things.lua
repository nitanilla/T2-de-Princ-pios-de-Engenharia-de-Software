	--[[
	Pre-condition: The function receives a valid non-empty string that
				   corresponds to a valid existent text file.
	Post-condition: The function generated a new DataStorageManager
					that contains a data element which contains the entire
					contents of the text file, whose path was passed as an
					argument, as a string.
	Argumentation: The function will correctly open the text file, given
				   that it is using native functions and that the pre-condition
				   is true. This in turn will make the data variable correctly be
				   the entire contents of the text file as a string. It the uses
				   the native setmetatable function, which will create the DataStorageManager
				   table.

	Pre-condition: The DataStorageManager already has a data element that
				   correctly contains the entire contents of a text file
				   as a string.
    Post-condition: The function returns a table containing words of the
					data string as each element.
	Argumentation: Considering that the pre-condition is true, the data
				   element of DataStorageManager will have a string that
				   corresponds to the entire contents of a text file, and
				   since it is already filtered from when the DataStorageManager
				   was created, the native functions used in this function will 
				   correctly separate the words and put then into the returned
				   table.

	Post-condition: The function returns a StopWordManager that
					contains a stopWords table, which contains stop
					words for elements.
	Argumentation: Considering that the pre-condition is true, it
				   will correctly open the stop_words.txt file since
				   it is correctly using native functions to open it.
				   As such, it will correctly fill the stopWordsTable
				   with stop words, given that it is using native
				   functions to parse the contents of the file text
				   that is turned into a string.

	Pre-condition: The function receives a non-empty string that
				   corresponds to a word. The StopWordManager table
				   has an element that contains all stop words in a
				   table.
	Post-condition: The function correctly identifies if the word
					passed as an argument is a stop word.
    Argumentation: Considering that the pre-condition is true, the 
				   stop words table will have all stop words, and as
				   such, it will parse through all stop words and then
				   correctly identify if it belongs to the table, which
				   will mean if it is a word stop or not.

					in the wordFrequencies table of the WordFrequencyManager.
	Argumentation: Considering the pre-condition to be true and that the
				   WordFrequencyManager has a non-empty WordFrequencies
				   table, it will correctly increment it given that it

	Post-condition: The function will correctly order the returned
					wordKeyTable by frequency.
	Argumentation: Given that the compare function correctly tells
				   which of two words has the most number of occurences,
				   the native sort function will correctly order the
				   wordKeyTable.

				   already argumented to do each step that leads to a sorted table. It then
